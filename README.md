![Chinese Stroke Order Sheet Generator Example Gif](example.gif)

I am sorry if forking is not the way to publish my code but I am new here, I am trying to learn.

### Chinese Character Stroke Order Sheet Generator

It is obviously self-explanatory, it creates stroke order sheets.

### How to use it?

You can just drag and drop the files to a web server but if you don't have a web server you can use XAMPP or something like that (I personally prefer WinNMP, It's better I guess).

For path extractor, just run the python file, it will go through all svgs in svgs folder and create path.

I feel like "Why am I explaining this?" but it's fun I think.

### Sources

- [makemehanzi](https://github.com/skishore/makemeahanzi/tree/master/svgs)'s animated svgs, extracted paths to make files smaller.

### TODOs

- Add definitions and pinyins of hanzis.

- Modify CSS for mobile environment so that next TODO can be done.

- Add integration for cordova.

- Add save as PDF or something like that for printing.
